# Todo List Web App

This is a simple and attractive Todo List web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
# CRUD Operations

This Todo List app demonstrates the four basic CRUD operations:

- **Create:** Add a new todo by typing in the input box and clicking the Add button.
- **Read:** All todos are displayed on the page when you open the app. The app reads from localStorage to show your saved todos.
- **Update:** Mark a todo as completed by clicking its checkbox. This updates its status in the list and in localStorage.
- **Delete:** Remove a todo by clicking the trash icon next to it. This deletes it from the list and from localStorage.

These operations are the foundation of most web applications that manage data.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Type a task in the input box and click **Add** to add it to your list.
3. Click the checkbox to mark a task as completed (it will be crossed out).
4. Click the trash icon to delete a task.
5. Click **Save** (if present) to save your list to your browser's local storage.

## File Structure
- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `index.css` - Styles for the app (background, fonts, layout, etc.)
- `learning.js` - JavaScript logic for adding, checking, deleting, and saving todos

## Customization
- You can change colors and fonts in `index.css` for a different look.
- The code is commented for easy learning and modification.
